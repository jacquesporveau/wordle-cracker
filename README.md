# Wordle Cracker

Wut it do?
This is a program that will help you cheat at Wordle so you can finally beat your family and feel superior about your word-guessing abilities.

## Usage

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then just follow the prompts and enter your feedback:

- `g` = green (you nailed it)
- `y` = yellow (close but no cigar)
- `b` = blank (that letter is trash)

The bot will suggest "CRANE" first because it's a smart cookie, then keep guessing until you either solve it or run out of tries (which shouldn't happen because this thing is pretty good).

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
